**1. Overview**
The OGBV Lexicon Monitoring System is an advanced solution designed to create a lexicon database specifically tailored for African languages and contexts. Utilizing AI and NLP, this system enhances the detection of online gender-based violence (OGBV) threats, ensuring sensitivity to cultural nuances and enabling real-time updates.

---

 **2. Problem Statement**
Digital Gender-Based Violence (DGBV) is rampant, particularly affecting individuals based on their gender identity, with a pronounced impact in Africa due to its linguistic and cultural diversity. Existing detectors often fail to identify abusive language in African languages, rendering them ineffective in providing appropriate preventive measures against OGBV.

---

 **3. Objectives**

**Main Objective:**  
Develop an Online Gender-Based Violence (OGBV) lexicon database that is relevant for African languages and contexts to address the prevalence of OGBV and promote awareness.

**Other Objectives:**  
- Propose an architecture for an online lexicon generation and update system using AI techniques.
- Ensure the availability of lexicons for various African languages to document the different linguistic variations.
- Enhance the realism of corpora by incorporating cultural nuances and slang from different regions.
- Incorporate new terms from reference materials to improve the efficiency of OGBV detectors.
- Establish a web-based tool that enables easy search and reorganization of lexicons by researchers and policymakers.

---

 **4. Implementation**

**Data Collection:**  
Data is collected from social networks, forums, and other sites reporting OGBV cases using web scraping tools like **Scrapy** or via APIs.

**NLP and AI Integration:**  
The data is analyzed using advanced NLP models such as **BERT** or **GPT** to detect and categorize abusive language relevant to African languages. Techniques like text classification and entity recognition are employed to identify OGBV-related terms and phrases.

**Real-Time Updates:**  
A pipeline is created to feed fresh abusive language patterns into the lexicons, ensuring they remain up-to-date and relevant, thereby improving detection accuracy.
